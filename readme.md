During this process, I was testing out different types of vinyl and mugs and how they work with each other.

I used signmaster software to create designs for testing and the vinyl cutter to cut out the designs. The 2 different vinyl types I used were permenant vinyl and HTV vinyl.

I also used 2 different types of mugs, ceramic mugs and sublimation ready mugs. I tried using the ceramic mugs with both HTV and permenant vinyl and it went pretty well as you can see from the designs.

I tried using HTV and permnenant vinyl on the sublimation mugs and as you can see from the pictures, it did not work out so well for both.
